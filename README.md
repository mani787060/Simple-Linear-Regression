# Simple Linear Regression
 
-> This project demonstrates the implementation of **Simple Linear Regression**, a foundational algorithm in supervised machine learning used for predicting continuous values.

## Objective:- 
 -> To understand the concept of linear relationship between two variables, implement regression manually, and compare results with **scikit-learn’s** built-in model.
 
## Key Concepts:-
-> Understanding correlation between independent and dependent variables  
-> Deriving the regression equation  
-> Visualizing the regression line  
-> Evaluating model accuracy  

## Libraries Used:-

-> numpy
-> pandas 
-> matplotlib
-> seaborn 
-> LinearRegression 
-> r2_score 
-> mean_absolute_error
-> mean_squared_error
